# MacOS9.2.1-on-Debian-ARM64
This project allows you to run macos9.2.1 on any ARM64 Debian-based OS using qemu-system-ppc.
Due to problems with the Internet Archive servers and Github's file upload size, the installer .iso file for MacOS9.2.1 used by this emulator is currently hosted on my Google Drive.
The URL is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zmJp8PpyDHffP6_ilcq86Im89xpfmJq/view?usp=drive_link
The file is called macos921.iso.zip. Once downloaded, you will need to extract it in order to obtain the .iso file for the emulator.
Before starting the emulator using the steps in the usage-instructions.txt file in the scripts.zip archive downloaded from this repo, be sure to EXTRACT THE scripts.zip FILE FROM THE REPO IN A SEPERATE EMPTY FOLDER.
Once this is done, create a new subfolder in the folder containing the extracted contents of the scripts.zip archive called "isos" as the launch.sh checks for the installer disk (macos9.2.1.iso) in that folder, which is where you ill have to place the .iso once downloaded from Google Drive.
Now you can read the usage-instructions.txt file to learn how to get started with the emulator.
