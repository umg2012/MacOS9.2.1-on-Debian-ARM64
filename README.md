# MacOS9.2.1-on-Debian-ARM64
The installer cd image for Mac OS 9.2.1 is NOT included in the scripts.zip file in this repo due to Github's size restrictions. The tested and working iso can be downloaded from Archive.org, from the URL: https://archive.org/details/macos9.2.1.
Before starting the emulator using the steps in the usage-instructions.txt file in the scripts.zip archive downloaded from this repo, be sure to EXTRACT THE scripts.zip FILE FROM THE REPO IN A SEPERATE EMPTY FOLDER.
Once this is done, create a new subfolder in the folder containing the extracted contents of the scripts.zip archive called "isos" as the launch.sh checks for the installer disk (macos9.2.1.iso) in that folder, which is where you ill have to place the .iso once downloaded from Google Drive.
Now you can read the usage-instructions.txt file to learn how to get started with the emulator.
